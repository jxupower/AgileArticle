## About the Article:

I thought that this article was interesting since it specifically analyzed the leaders in Agile organizations. The argument is that most leaders in these organizations are themselves not agile but rather enforce an agile environment to their subordinates. The article claims a lot of 'Agile' organizations have a very centralized chain of command. A truly Agile organization is very decentralized. In conclusion, it calls for the leaders of these organizations to be agile themselves.

I was interested in this article because it spoke more about the human capital portion of software engineering. The concept of "being fully Agile" and decentralized versus centralized chain of command was something that us software engineering students can consider before entering the work force.
